    <description>A fully configurable mod that displays extra information on screen. Tailored specificllay for streamers who are tired of answering the same questions all the time like &quot;what character are your playing ?&quot; or &quot;can you share the seed ?&quot; and such. 

Works best with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2487535818]Mod Config[/url] to configure the block position, which information you want to display, and more!

This mod is open source. The code can be found on [url=https://github.com/Gyoo/FoundHudPlusPlus]GitHub[/url]. Any help is welcome, please check the issues board to see what needs to be done. If you have issues, this is also the place to let me know!
